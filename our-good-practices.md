## Defining Good Practices for our Coding Project:

### See bullets of discussed details below:

#### Variable naming:
* Variables should be named universally understanably
* ideally self explainatory
* names should rather be shorter than longer
* Ideally variables used should be mentioned in the end of a document/file/notebook

###  Function naming:
* Functions should be named universally understanably
* ideally self explainatory
* Function names including their description should be listed in the end of the file/notebook or in a seperate file

### Libraries:
* Libraries should all be imported in the very beginning of the file and document
* Should uncommon libraries by imported, a short discription following import is desirable

### Community conventions:
* Fun and respect from all sides


### Git and Repository Management:
* Communication regarding ones workflow and status of local repository is important
* The repository of the master branch owner will be updated to the remote repository and prepared for pulls from other team members regularly
* Folder structure should be logical and efficient

### Workflow Organisation:
* Team Meeting are held daily
* Notes from meetings are taken in common digital spaces such as the Slides doc or the Trello Board. 
* The Readme file is updated after every meeting
* At the end of every meeting next steps, responsibilities and goals until the next checkpoint are clear to all team members
